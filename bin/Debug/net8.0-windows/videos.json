It\u2019s a car that\u2019s spanned four decades through three different guises and ended production in November 2023.

    "Description": "The Audi RS2 represented the final step in Audi\u2019s transition to becoming a full-fledged performance marque that could compete with BMW and Mercedes. After lying dormant for decades, the Audi name was resurrected as part of the Volkswagen group in 1965 and produced\u2026rather conventional cars. In 1972, Ferdinand Pi\u00EBch joined the company and set about turning Audi\u2019s products around with a focus on technical innovation. By joining a groundbreaking turbocharged 5-cylinder engine with the now iconic quattro all wheel drive system, Pi\u00EBch and his engineers created not just a series of motorsport coups, but genuinely covetable road cars as well.\r\nThe RS2 is among the most desirable of all, combining the superb competition-bred powertrain that drove almost all of Audi\u2019s racing success with Porsche-engineered upgrades to create the first ever Audi RS car. In this video, Derek Tam-Scott traces the history of Audi RS2 and gets behind the wheel to discover its true character."

A 4.2-litre naturally aspirated V8 developing 414bhp, it would take the fight to another N/A monsters from both BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Under the hood is a twin-turbo 4.2L V8 pushing 444 hp. Truly an epic Audi that no one is talking about. "
